## Introduction

This library provides a set of functions to work with images represented as matrices of pixel values. It offers functionalities to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, convolution, black and white filtering, channel manipulation, and more.

## Features

- Load images from files
- Basic arithmetic operations on images
- Convolution with custom kernels
- Black and white filtering
- Channel manipulation
- Drawing rectangles on images

## Installation

To use this library, simply include the `image.h` header file in your C project, along with the `stb_image.h` and `stb_image_write.h` libraries, which are included by default.

```c
#include "image.h"
```

## Usage

The library provides a set of functions that operate on the `Image` struct defined in `image.h`. Before using any functions, make sure to allocate memory for the `Image` struct using the provided functions.

```c
Image myImage = Image_Alloc(100, 100, 3); // Allocate a 100x100 RGB image
```

Once an image is allocated, you can perform various operations on it, such as saving the image, applying filters, manipulating channels, and more.

## Examples

Here's an example of loading an image, applying a filter, and saving the result:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "image.h"

int main() {
    // Load an image from file
    Image inputImage = Image_Alloc_Name("input.jpg");

    // Apply a custom kernel for convolution
    float customKernel[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    Image filteredImage = Image_Apply_Kernel(inputImage, customKernel, 3, 3);

    // Save the filtered image
    Image_Save(filteredImage, "output.jpg");

    // Free allocated memory
    Image_Free(inputImage);
    Image_Free(filteredImage);

    return 0;
}
```
